I first solved it with brute force! (Puzzle.py)
Complexity should be: O(n^2)

Puzzle2.py I started with deque for sorting so that bought the complexity down to O(n log n)

(Disclaimer:I have also used the default sort function of python which inherently uses Timsort, its complexity being O(n log n))
